Kryvos
========

Kryvos is a file encryptor and decryptor. It encrypts files with AES using the Botan cryptography library.

Getting Started
---------------
To install Krvyos, extract the files from the Kryvos archive. Execute the Kryvos executable in the extracted directory to begin. More detailed instructions can be found in the INSTALL file.

Theming
-------
Kryvos supports user theming. To create your own theme, start with the kryvos.qss file in the themes directory as your template. The kryvos.qss file is a stylesheet file that has syntax very similar to CSS. Colors, fonts, and many other attributes can be styled. Save your stylesheet file inside of the themes folder. To apply your theme to Kryvos, edit the settings.ini file located in the same directory as kryvos.exe. Change the value styleSheetPath to your newly created stylesheet file.

Example: You created a new theme and saved the stylesheet to myTheme.qss in the themes folder. You would then update settings.ini with this value: styleSheetPath=myTheme.qss

Developers
----------
If you'd like to contribute to Kryvos, check the project out on GitHub. You'll need Qt 5 and Botan 1.11. Development is performed primarily in Qt Creator with gcc (MinGW-w64 on Windows) for cross-platform compatibility.

Windows
A build of Botan performed with MinGW-w64 for x64 and x86 is located in the include and lib folder on Github. You can use it or build your own.
To build x64 or x86, comment and uncomment the lines containing x64 or x86, respectively, in the kryvos.pro file.

Linux
Botan hasn't been built for Linux yet, but will be soon. The kryvos.pro file contains a conditional build rule for directories with Linux compatible include and library files.
