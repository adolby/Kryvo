#Kryvos

Kryvos is an open-source file encryptor and decryptor. It encrypts files with AES and Serpent using [Botan](https://botan.randombit.net/), a great cryptography library written in C++11.

##Getting Started

###Installation
To install Kryvos on Windows or Linux, run the installer executable or extract the files from the Kryvos archive. To install Kryvos on macOS, extract the disk image archive, then mount the disk image. Drag Kryvos.app to your Applications folder. Once the install files are copied, run the Kryvos executable.

###Solving Windows missing DLL error
If you receive an error indicating a missing msvcp140.dll, vcruntime140.dll, or other DLL files when you run Kryvos, you'll need to install the Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable (x64).

The Visual C++ Redistributable installer is located where you installed Kryvos (default directory for the installer is C:\Program Files\Kryvos\). Its file name is vcredist_x64.exe.

Run the Visual C++ Redistributable installer, and you should then be able to start Kryvos.

###Using Kryvos
Add files by clicking/tapping the Add Files button and selecting them in the dialog or by dragging and dropping files to the Kryvos window. Press encrypt or decrypt to process the entire list.

Files are encrypted/decrypted one-to-one, meaning that encryption of a "file.txt" will yield an encrypted "file.txt.enc" and decryption of "file.txt.enc" will yield a decrypted "file (2).txt".

##Theming

Kryvos supports user theming. To create your own theme, start with the kryvos.qss file in the themes directory as your template. The kryvos.qss file is a stylesheet file that has syntax very similar to CSS.

Colors, fonts, and many other attributes can be styled. Save your stylesheet file inside of the themes folder. To apply your theme to Kryvos, edit the settings.ini file located in the same directory as kryvos.exe. Change the value styleSheetPath to your newly created stylesheet file.

Example: You created a new theme and saved the stylesheet to myTheme.qss in the themes folder. You would then update settings.json with this value: styleSheetPath: myTheme.qss

##Developers

If you'd like to contribute to Kryvos, you can fork the project on GitHub and submit a pull request. To build Kryvos, you'll need Qt 5.2 (or later), Botan 1.11.32, and a C++14 capable compiler.

Amalgamation configurations of Botan are included in the source tree to simplify the build setup. Android requires a small patch that implements std::string to_string(), which is missing from the NDK STL. The patch, android_to_string.hpp, is included by botan_all.h. Both files are located at src/cryptography/botan/android/. The configuration commands used to generate minimal Botan amalgamation files follows for each platform:

###Android (ARM)
python configure.py --cpu=armv5te --os=linux --amalgamation --disable-shared

###Linux GCC x86_64
python configure.py --cc=gcc --amalgamation --disable-shared

###Linux Clang x86_64
python configure.py --cc=clang --amalgamation --disable-shared

###macOS Clang x86_64
python configure.py --cc=clang --amalgamation --disable-shared --disable-modules=darwin_secrandom

###iOS Clang
python configure.py --cpu=armv7 --cc=clang --amalgamation --disable-shared --disable-modules=darwin_secrandom

###Windows Visual Studio x86_64
python configure.py --cpu=x64 --cc=msvc --os=windows --amalgamation --disable-shared
