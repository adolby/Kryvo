Kryvos
========

Kryvos is a file encryptor and decryptor. It encrypts files with AES using the Botan cryptography library.

Getting Started
---------------
To install Krvyos, extract the files from the Kryvos archive. Execute the Kryvos executable in the extracted directory to begin.
More detailed instructions can be found in the INSTALL file.

Theming
-------
Kryvos supports user theming. To create your own theme, start with the kryvos.qss file in the themes directory as your template.
The kryvos.qss file is a stylesheet file that has syntax very similar to CSS. Colors, fonts, and many other attributes can be styled.
Save your stylesheet file inside of the themes folder. To apply your theme to Kryvos, edit the settings.ini file located in the same
directory as kryvos.exe. Change the value styleSheetPath to your newly created stylesheet file.

Example: You created a new theme and saved the stylesheet to myTheme.qss in the themes folder. You would then update settings.ini with
this value: styleSheetPath=myTheme.qss
